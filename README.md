Linkedin Scraper
================

**2.0.0 is the new version. It does not support the `get_profile` method. It does not support Ruby 1.8**

Linkedin-scraper is a gem for scraping linkedin public profiles.
Given the URL of the profile, it gets the name, country, title, area, current companies, past companies,
organizations, skills, groups, etc


## Installation

Install the gem from RubyGems:

    gem install linkedin-scraper

This gem is tested on 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.2, 2.3

## Usage
Include the gem

    require 'linkedin-scraper'

Initialize a scraper instance

    profile = Linkedin::Profile.new("http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08")


With a http web-proxy:

    profile = Linkedin::Profile.new("http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08", { proxy_ip: '127.0.0.1', proxy_port: '3128', username: 'user', password: 'pass' })

The scraper can also get the details of each past and current companies. This will lead to multiple hits.
To enable this functionality, pass `company_details=true` in options. You can pass them along with proxy options
as well

    profile = Linkedin::Profile.new("http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08", { company_details: true })

    profile = Linkedin::Profile.new("http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08", { company_details: true, proxy_ip: '127.0.0.1', proxy_port: '3128', username: 'user', password: 'pass' })

It's also possible to set number of seconds to wait for the connection to open.
Scraper will throw exception after given timeout. E. g. to set two seconds long timeout
pass `open_timeout: 2` in options. Defaults to 60 seconds.

    profile = Linkedin::Profile.new("http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08", {open_timeout: 2 })

The returning object responds to the following methods


    profile.first_name          # The first name of the contact

    profile.last_name           # The last name of the contact

    profile.name                # The full name of the profile

    profile.title               # The job title

    profile.summary             # The summary of the profile

    profile.location            # The location of the contact

    profile.country             # The country of the contact

    profile.industry            # The domain for which the contact belongs

    profile.picture             # The profile picture link of profile

    profile.skills              # Array of skills of the profile

    profile.organizations       # Array organizations of the profile

    profile.education           # Array of hashes for education

    profile.volunteering        # Array of hashes for volunteering

    profile.websites            # Array of websites

    profile.groups              # Array of groups

    profile.recommendations     # Array of recommendations

    profile.languages           # Array of languages

    profile.certifications      # Array of certifications

  	profile.number_of_connections # The number of connections as a string


For current and past companies it also provides the details of the companies like company size, industry, address, etc
The company details will only be scraped if you pass company_details=true. It is false by default.
